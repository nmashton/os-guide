# The OpenSpending Guide (English)

The OpenSpending Guide is the manual for OpenSpending. It leads new users through the process of finding, adding, and using data with OpenSpending in clear, step-by-step language.

You can read the Guide [on the OpenSpending help site](http://blog.openspending.org/help/guide/).

## The Guide repo

This GitHub repository is where the source code of the OpenSpending Guide will live, in the form of a set of MarkDown files. Problems with the Guide and suggestions for how it can be improved can be left as issues.

For now, this repository contains only the source for the original English edition of the guide. In the future, it will contain:

* source for translations of the Guide
* a Python script which automatically updates the WordPress site
