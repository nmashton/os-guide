# The OpenSpending Guide (English)

The OpenSpending Guide is the manual for OpenSpending. It leads new users through the process of finding, adding, and using data with OpenSpending in clear, step-by-step language.

This GitHub repository is where the main branch of the OpenSpending Guide will live, in the form of a set of MarkDown files. Problems with the Guide and suggestions for how it can be improved can be left as issues.

In the future, this repository will contain:

* source code for translations of the Guide
* a Python script which automatically updates the WordPress site with the latest revisions
