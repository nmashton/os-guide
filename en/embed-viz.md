You can easily embed any of the visualizations created on OpenSpending on your own website. This means you can have the full interactive displays on your site.

Let's say you have chosen a visualization on the OpenSpending platform. Notice there's an **Embed** button at the bottom right of the webpage. Click this button and you'll be presented with the code to embed the visualization on your website and some options for the size (in pixels) of the interactive. The rest is just cutting and pasting this code into your site. If you are unsure how to paste the code correctly, contact your site administrator.

The reason it's possible to embed code comes down to *widgets*. In very simplified terms, a widget is a piece of code you can add into your webpage, and it pulls data – in this case, from the OpenSpending database – so you don't need to store datasets yourself.
